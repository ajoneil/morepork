# morepork - Build the CLI, FFI library, and adapters

# Usage:
#   make cli       - Build target/release/morepork
#   make ffi       - Build target/release/libmorepork_ffi.a
#   make adapters  - Build every adapter binary in adapters/<emu>/
#   make missingno-sg1000 / missingno-colecovision
#                  - Build the missingno adapter binaries for the TI VDP corpus
#   make clean     - Remove build artifacts
