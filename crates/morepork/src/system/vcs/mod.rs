//! The Atari 2600 (VCS) family. NTSC/PAL are models within this family.
//!
//! The VCS is the stress test of the per-frame-dimensions model: there is
//! no hardware frame, only the software's sync pattern, so frame height is
//! emergent and every `frame` snapshot carries its own dimensions
//! (`snapshot::IndexedFrame`). The catalogue starts with the state
//! missingno-vcs exposes publicly (the 6507's register file, the TIA beam
//! position, RIOT timer and ports); adapters can carry anything else as
//! extension fields.
