"""Generate the canonical VCS NTSC/PAL/SECAM palettes for every gbtrace VCS adapter.

A GOLD (frame) test's verdict is a captured frame compared against a golden
reference. The pixels a VCS adapter stores are TIA colour codes (the COLUxx
byte, 0..254 even) — emulator-independent. The palette (colour code -> RGB) is
NOT: each emulator ships slightly different RGB. So the SUITE declares ONE
canonical palette per TV standard and every adapter embeds it, so `gbtrace
render` produces the identical golden PNG no matter which oracle captured the
trace.

Canonical NTSC/PAL palettes = Stella's `ourNTSCPalette` / `ourPALPalette` (the
de-facto community standard). 128 hue/luma colours indexed by (colour code >> 1).
We emit a 256-entry RGB table indexed by the raw colour byte: even index = the
colour, odd index = black (TIA ignores bit 0, and 0xFF is our blank/vblank
sentinel, so it must render black too).

SECAM is fundamentally different: the console has no hue on SECAM. The luminance
nibble alone (bits 3..1 of the colour byte, i.e. `(code >> 1) & 7`) selects one
of only 8 fixed, fully-saturated colours; the hue nibble is ignored entirely. So
the SECAM 128-entry table is the 8 colours tiled 16 times — two codes that
differ only in hue render identically. Canonical SECAM = Stella's `ourSECAMPalette`.
