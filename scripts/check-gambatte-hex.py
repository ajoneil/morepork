"""Check if a rendered Game Boy frame matches a Gambatte hex output value.

Reads a 160x144 PNG and checks if the top-left corner shows the expected
hex digits using the Gambatte testrunner's tile patterns.

The comparison uses brightness thresholding (>128 = light, <=128 = dark)
to handle any palette.

Usage: check-gambatte-hex.py <expected_hex> <png_file>
Returns exit code 0 if match, 1 if mismatch.
